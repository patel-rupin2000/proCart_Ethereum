<h3>Why to Use Ethereum</h3>

<h5>Smart contracts guarantee security</h5>
The Ethereum platform has as its main objective smart contracts, which are executed safely and without the need for third party intervention (since these are designed in such    a way that “yes or yes” is fulfilled).

<h5>It’s not regulated by government entities</h5>
No government entity exercises control over Ethereum, so it is difficult to control its value and it will depend solely on the trust of users and the volume of transactions that are made with it, which gives users peace of mind that When paying with Ethereum, the money will go directly to the owner of the product or service that is paid, without anyone else intervening.

<h5>It’s developed with open source</h5>
Ethereum is developed in an open source system, which allows improvements when necessary. This benefits the users of the platform as it gives more stability and transparency, and if an error or failure occurs in any transaction, it could be solved by entering the source code of it.

<h5>It’s very hard to fake</h5>
One of the biggest fears in financial transactions are scams or counterfeit money, which is very common with fiat money since being papers can be easily printed (with a similar result), without having any legal validity . In the case of Ethereum that is not possible because it is a virtual currency with its own identifiers that make it unique.

<h5>It’s cheaper</h5>
In the case of Ethereum, its use is cheaper due to the absence of third parties, this makes it a much more profitable payment option compared to other currencies or traditional means of payment, especially when used to make purchases over the Internet or even when It is decided to make payments in physical stores or commercial premises.
The app also gives facility to search nearby hospitals and hotels and other safe places thus also allow user to know his/her current location.
